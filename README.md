# 🏃‍♂️ PPO BipedalWalker-v3 Agent  
🧠 **Mastering Locomotion via Reinforcement Learning**  
> A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent trained to walk in the `BipedalWalker-v3` environment using **Stable-Baselines3** and **Gymnasium**. This project demonstrates continuous control in a physics-based world, simulating complex bipedal locomotion.
